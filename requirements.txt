## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

To run the code in these notebooks, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/anikashraful/python-ds-ml-roadmap.git
    cd python-ds-ml-roadmap
    ```

2.  **(Recommended) Create a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv ds-roadmap-env
    source ds-roadmap-env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `ds-roadmap-env\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3.  **Install the required dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## 🚀 Usage

Each Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb` file) is self-contained for its respective week. Simply navigate to the weekly folder and launch Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter lab
# or
jupyter notebook

### 2. `requirements.txt`

This file lists all the Python packages needed to run the code in your notebooks. You can start with this comprehensive list and it will cover you for most of the year. You can install others (like `torch` or `transformers`) in specific weekly notebooks if needed.
