# 1-Year Python, Data Science & Machine Learning Roadmap 🚀

This repository documents my personal journey through a structured, project-based 12-month roadmap for mastering Python, Data Science, and Machine Learning.

The roadmap is designed for consistent, daily practice, building from core programming fundamentals all the way to advanced ML concepts, deployment, and specialization.

## 📚 Roadmap Overview

The 12-month plan is broken down as follows:

*   **Months 1-2:** Python Fundamentals & Intermediate Python
*   **Months 3-4:** Data Science Libraries (NumPy, Pandas) & Math/Stats Foundations
*   **Months 5-6:** Core Machine Learning (Regression, Classification, Clustering, Ensembles)
*   **Months 7-8:** Advanced Topics, End-to-End Projects, and Specialization
*   **Month 9:** Capstone Project (Full Data Science Workflow)
*   **Month 10:** Advanced ML Project (Interpretation & Refinement)
*   **Months 11-12:** Review, Deep Learning, Career Prep, and Consolidation

## 🗂️ Repository Structure

The repository is organized by week, with each week containing a Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) that encapsulates the key concepts, exercises, and mini-projects for that week.
